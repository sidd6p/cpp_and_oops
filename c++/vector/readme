Vector is a template class in STL (Standard Template Library) of C++ programming language. C++ vectors are sequence containers that store elements.

Specifically used to work with dynamic data, C++ vectors may expand depending on the elements they contain. That makes it different from a fixed-size array.

C++ vectors can automatically manage storage. It is efficient if you add and delete data often. Bear in mind however, that a vector might consume more memory than an array.

Vectors C++ are preferable when managing ever-changing data elements.

It is handy if you don’t know how big the data is beforehand since you don’t need to set the maximum size of the container. Since it’s possible to resize C++ vectors, it offers better flexibility to handle dynamic elements.

C++ vectors offer excellent efficiency. It is a template class, which means no more typing in the same code to handle different data.

If you use vectors, you can copy and assign other vectors with ease. There are different ways to do that: using the iterative method, assignment operator =, an in-built function, or passing vector as a constructor.

In C++ vectors, automatic reallocation happens whenever the total amount of memory is used. This reallocation relates to how size and capacity function works.

Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.
Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the array.
Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.
